    While <b>Brittany</b> is certainly expressing the most pleasure, there are a few things that make me want to
    cry
    foul. Her expression is, simply put, not authentic. This leads me to my next piece of evidence: Alvin's face. That
    is not a face of sexual delight. Alvin is experiencing erectile disfunction, and <b>Brittany</b> is thinking
    that
    it's because of her. This leads her to moan and be more expressive, which may convince uneducated people to think
    that she is getting the best dick. The truth is, it's quite the opposite. Look at the way Alvin is looking to his
    left. That is a face of pure embarrassment and shame. <b>Brittany</b> is arguably getting the worst dick and, bless
    her
    heart, she's not showing it.
    <h2>Theodore</h2><hr>
    Now, over to Theodore. This is a classic case of pussy being too good, as it has led to him falling asleep and and
    thus lose performance. Based on what we learned from "Who's getting the best head" (2019), we can safely assume that
    Theodore is big enough to keep Eleanor pleased, but he is lacking in speed and endurance.
    <h2><b>Simon</b></h2><hr>
    For one, look at <b>Simon's</b> face compared to the other chipmunks. This man is so in the zone that he isn't even
    feeling
    pleasure at this point. It's pure performance from him, and Jeanette is feeling the repercussions. Shifting back to
    Jeanette, she is getting dicked down so well and so authentically that she doesn't have the energy to even open her
    mouth, let alone moan. <b>Simon</b> and Jeanette are the definition of intimacy; she is being driven to climax while
    he is
    just happy to be pleasing the chipette he loves to much. Lets briefly explore the other options.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2><hr>
    This leads me to my final conclusion: the chipettes getting the best dick in order or best to worst are Jeanette,
    Eleanor, lastly <b>Brittany</b>. Poor <b>Brittany</b>.
